      "Okay, the user asked for the current price of gold. I used the get_commodity_price tool with \"gold\" as the input. The response came back with a price of 3365.2. Now I need to present this information clearly. The observation shows the price is 3365.2, so I'll format that into a readable answer. Let me make sure to mention the exchange and the updated time too, so the user knows it's the latest data. Alright, time to put it all together in a natural way.\n",
