But wait, in the previous examples, sometimes organizations are mentioned. But here, the Eiffel Tower is a landmark, not an organization. So maybe the entities are Eiffel Tower (Location), Paris (Location), France (Location). But I need to check if the user considers the Eiffel Tower as a Location or maybe as a proper noun. But according to the examples, in example 1, \"Paris\" is a Location. So in this case, the Eiffel Tower is a Location, and Paris and France are also Locations. So the answer should be those three. But wait, maybe the user expects only the main locations. Wait, the sentence says \"located in Paris, France.\" So Paris and France are both locations. The Eiffel Tower is a specific location. So the entities are Eiffel Tower (Location), Paris (Location), France (Location). But in the previous examples, sometimes the same entity is mentioned once. But in example 3, \"Amazon is headquartered in Seattle.\" So Amazon is an organization, Seattle is a location. So in this case, the Eiffel Tower is a location, and Paris and France are locations. So the answer should be those three. But maybe the user is expecting only the two locations, Paris and France, and the Eiffel Tower as a location. But the Eiffel Tower is a specific entity. So I think the correct entities are Eiffel Tower (Location), Paris (Location), France (Location). But I need to check if the user considers the Eiffel Tower as a Location.

      "**Completeness:**  \n",
      "The summary is thorough, covering the main points of the paper, including:  \n",
      "- **CRISPR-Cas9 development and mechanisms** (e.g., RNA-guided targeting, double-nicking, truncated guide RNAs).  \n",
      "- **Applications** (e.g., genome editing in mammals, plants, and microbes).  \n",

      "Okay, I need to update the summary based on the feedback provided. Let me start by reading through the original summary and the feedback carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original summary is a comprehensive review of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The feedback says it's accurate, clear, and complete, but there are minor suggestions for improvement. The user wants me to adjust the summary to address those points.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the feedback mentions that the summary could briefly mention the role of Cas9 nickase and dimeric FokI nucleases in improving specificity. In the original summary, I might have skipped over those details. I should add a sentence or two about how these tools contribute to specificity improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the feedback says the acknowledgment of HHMI and NIH funding is correctly noted, but the summary could clarify that these are the primary sources. The original summary mentions \"primary sources\" in the acknowledgment section, so maybe that's already there. But perhaps I should make that more explicit, like stating that these are the main funding sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should check the original summary to see where the mention of Cas9 nickase and dimeric FokI nucleases is. If they're not mentioned, I need to add them. The original summary does mention \"Cas9 nickase\" and \"dimeric FokI nucleases\" in the applications section, so maybe that's covered. Wait, the feedback says \"could briefly mention the role of the Cas9 nickase and dimeric FokI nucleases in improving specificity,\" so maybe the original summary doesn't have that. Let me check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, the original summary under \"Applications\" includes: \"Efficient genome modification by CRISPR-Cas9 nickase with minimal off-target effects\" and \"Dimeric CRISPR RNA-guided FokI nucleases for highly specific genome editing.\" So those are there. But the feedback says that the summary could briefly mention their role in improving specificity. Maybe the original summary doesn't explicitly state that these tools are critical for specificity. So I should add a sentence that connects these tools to improving specificity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, in the acknowledgment section, the original summary says \"J.A.D. is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and a member of the Center for RNA Systems Biology at UC Berkeley (J. Cate, P.I.).\" The feedback says that the acknowledgment of HHMI and NIH funding is correctly noted, but the summary could clarify that these are the primary sources. The original summary mentions \"supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research, the Helmholtz Association, the German Research Foundation, the Göran Gustafsson Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Kempe Foundation, and Umeå University. J.A.D. acknowledges financial support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, NSF, the Gates Foundation, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, and NIH.\" So the HHMI and NIH are listed as funding sources, but the feedback says to clarify that these are the primary sources. Maybe the original summary doesn't explicitly state that, so I should add a sentence like \"J.A.D. is primarily supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and NIH.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the original summary says \"J.A.D. acknowledges financial support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, NSF, the Gates Foundation, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, and NIH.\" So the HHMI and NIH are among the sources, but the feedback says to clarify that these are the primary sources. So maybe the original summary doesn't make that clear. Therefore, I should add a sentence in the acknowledgment section to clarify that these are the primary sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the revised summary should include a mention of Cas9 nickase and dimeric FokI nucleases in the context of improving specificity, and clarify that HHMI and NIH are the primary funding sources for J.A.D.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure that these additions are concise and fit within the summary without making it too lengthy. Also, check that the rest of the summary remains accurate and clear.\n",

      "**Revised Summary:**  \n",
      "\n",
      "This review provides a comprehensive overview of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, highlighting its development, mechanisms, and applications in genome editing across mammals, plants, and microbes. The paper details the core principles of CRISPR-Cas9, including RNA-guided targeting, double-nicking, and the use of truncated guide RNAs to enhance specificity. Key applications include genome modification in adult mice, with notable examples such as the use of **Cas9 nickase** and **dimeric FokI nucleases** to minimize off-target effects and improve editing precision.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The review also addresses critical challenges, such as off-target effects, and discusses tools for optimizing and analyzing CRISPR-Cas9 systems, including **CHOPCHOP**, **GT-Scan**, and **sgRNAcas9**, which aid in designing efficient guide RNAs and assessing potential off-target sites. The paper emphasizes the importance of specificity improvements, such as the use of dimeric FokI nucleases and truncated guide RNAs, to enhance the accuracy of genome editing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The authors acknowledge their affiliations and funding sources, with **J.A.D.** primarily supported by the **Howard Hughes Medical Institute** and **NIH**, while **E.C.** receives support from multiple institutions, including the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the Swedish Research Council. The review underscores the transformative potential of CRISPR-Cas9 while addressing ongoing challenges in its implementation and optimization.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Improvements:**  \n",
      "1. Explicitly highlights the role of **Cas9 nickase** and **dimeric FokI nucleases** in improving specificity.  \n",
      "2. Clarifies that the **Howard Hughes Medical Institute** and **NIH** are the primary funding sources for J.A.D.  \n",
